# Learning notes

Taking notes on books I read, talks I watch and articles I study, recalling them right afterwards by creating short
summaries, helps a lot on my learning process. Here you'll find some of those little pieces.

### Talk notes

* [Maybe Not](talks/maybe-not.md) by **Rich Hickey**, 2018.


### Conference notes

* [Lambda World 2017](conferences/Lambda%20World%202017)

### Article notes

This is my personal learning space. I keep it for my personal enjoyment, if you are thinking about adding your own
summaries it may be a better idea to start your own.
