# FP Degustation Menu - @hannelita

Talk description:
> Too many flavours of Functional Programming? Don't worry - like a French bouchon; we will try a taste of some famous languages, and see what they look like. You can pick up your favourite one for the next visit! Using a simple project idea (building an API), we will go through the following menu:

Main goal:
> How could I persuade my teams to adopt FP?

Intro:
* There are so many FP introductions videos in youtube.
* Many are brilliant but not practical.
* A lot are using the same Shape/Polygon example


## How to introduce FP to a team never had any contact with FP

Example: A big data company (scrapping company)
  * Easy to add `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`...
  * With the same language their were programming (python)
  * You'll realize that the language you were using it's not as potent as you wanted
    - Good change to discuss mutability, i/o...

Practical exercise to dive into FP: 2 batteries example (9v and 12v)
  * Introduce streams, lazy eval...
  * Good moment to introduce DSL
  * Invest money on it
  * Maybe change the language? (haskell, elixir...)
  
Practical exercise: A DSL in Haskell with Servant: To use the Amazon API

It there are interested people they will polonaise the FP to other team members.


## Indigestion: Team of C programmers trying to introduce scala

Problem: Too much concepts to learn (fp + a new language)

Take aways/Final words:
  * MirageOS -> DevOps with FP taste
  * Actors
  * Category Theory
  * GIFs

Thoughts:
 * The description doesn't accomplish the talk
 * Expected code, not how to teach FP
